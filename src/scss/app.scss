// DOCUMENTATION
// To use the different variables and mixins in your project, you can import the folder base and use the variables and mixins from there.

// Example:
// imports from another folder
// @use "../base" as base;
// @use "../ui" as ui;

// .btn-primary {
//     @include ui.button(base.$white, base.$black, none, 5px, 10px 20px)
//   }
// The button is using the button mixin from the ui folder and the variables from the base folder.

// To use variables, mixins or function from the same folder, you have to @use the file directly (see example in ROOT file).
